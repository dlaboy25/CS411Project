# 411 Project: Spotify Roadtrip

Members: Jason Kim, Derek Laboy, Carol Riady, Izzy Handkammer, Grace Dai

The Tech Stack is in the docs folder but here is a brief overview: Frontend - React Backend - Firebase OAuth - Spotify OAuth

The official branch for this project is Spotify-Branch NOT main. There were some issues when storing our code in a prototype folder so our prototype code is in the folder named "spotigo".

Installation & Setup Instructions:

1. Please make sure you have Node installed on your program. 
2. Go into the spotigo directory and type in the command line "npm install". This should install all the dependencies.
3. Create a .env file in the spotigo/backend and assign GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY your API key from the Google developer console. 
4. In the backend folder run "node server.js".
5. In the Spotigo folder run "npm start".
